## <b> Things I have learned that I think is cool </b>

- The anatomical name for the human thumb is <b> Pollux </b>.
  - The name pollux is originated from the root -poll, which is the same root that the word politician comes from. The root also has similar origins as the common saying "I have you under my thumb". The thumb is thought to be an originator of power and strength. Therefore, for this reason, politicians have great power in their governmental role. 
  
- The <b> Hyaline Cartilage </b> is a very translucent material found in the body. It lines many places nearby bones and joints. It is critical to the development of bone; even within the developing human being. It forms the embryonic skeleton. It is also found within the trachea.
 
 <i> hyalo- </i>
 
- The root word comes from Greek hyalos "glass, clear alabaster, crystal lens used as a burning glass,". This apparently had origins in a non-Greek word, said to be of Egyptian origin. It is thought that glass was first large-scale produced in Egypt.

## <b> The Biblical Connection to Glass and "Hyaline" </b>

<i> "and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind" Revelation 4:6 ESV </i>

<b> Pronunciation: \ˈhī-ə-lən \ </b>

## Mnemonic for learning: High-e-len. We will recall that God is seated on high, on His throne, and surrounded by a sea of glass, like crystal. "But You, Lord , are on high forevermore." Psalms 92:8 NKJV

## <b> How To Remember the 15 Human Tissue Types </b>

Mnemonic for learning: TLC-MD (Tender Loving Care-Medical Doctor)

Story to connect the pieces of TLC-MD; In the Air Force if someone falls and breaks a <b> bone </b> (BON) we will write an <b> after-action-report </b> (AAR). This is certain to occur if it happens at <b> F.E. Warren, AFB. </b> (FEH). Before the person can leave, we must run a <b> spinal-cord simulation </b> (SCS). If all goes well we will go to <b> Recreational Equipment Inc. </b> (REI) because we want to have better gear to prevent falling and breaking a bone.
