<b> What do Legos have to do with ligaments? </b>

In my first semester of Human Anatomy we discussed in great detail the inner parts of the body. The one common misconception was the differences between ligaments and tendons. In studying I used a memory aid. Ligaments are like Legos because they are hard and you always connect Legos to other Legos. This leads to the idea that bones are connected to other bones using "Lego"ments. 

As a future teaching tool I would use Legos to connect bones. The anterior side of the Lego would have labels stating the ligament name and the posterior side of the Lego would have the bone location. For the ACL there would be two Legos. Both Legos would match on one side and complement each other on the other.

Example for the ACL:

Lego 1, Posterior: intercondyloid eminence of the tibia
Lego 2, Posterior: anterior horn of the lateral meniscus
