<b> Fitbit </b>

This is a place where I will talk about my experience with the Fitbit.

## Inspire HR

My have two main dislikes of my first Fitbit (Inspire HR).

<b> #1 </b>
- The alarm, chrono, and timekeeping functions are weak.
-- It takes three swipes up to even get to the timer function (four swipes for alarms). I can set a timer or alarm on my Timex in under 3-5 seconds.

<b> #2 </b>
- Notifications and smart-phone interactions are weak.
-- Notification pop-ups often disappear and are not able to be pulled back again. They are also hard to read and you can't respond.

## Android App

The android application for Fitbit has been a mostly good experience. There is plenty of graphics and charts to see in relation to my heart rate, weight, and steps taken.
