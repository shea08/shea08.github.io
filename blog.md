"North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota"

You might overlook this quote from the popular Red Hot Chili Peppers song, but when you live in the state you can't help wonder -- What were they talking about?
My best guess is this is a connection to the great adventure settlers embarked on during their travels out west for gold. I've never considered ND a "western" area and in fact Minot was considered the end of the line on the rail road. Minot is a small city in north central ND. 

Another blog described it pretty well and even used the verse from the RHCPs to name the blog (very creative):

<a href="https://gunninforthequota.wordpress.com/about-2/"> "Yes, I am going to North Dakota, a state with fewer people than Cobb County, Georgia.  The natural gas boom in the Bakken Region of western North Dakota has spurred sensational growth in the state, and just like the days of yore with gold mining and oil drilling, people are flocking to cash in on the riches.
Me?  Well, Iâ€™m no prospector, and even if I was, the time to strike it rich in North Dakota has unfortunately come and gone." </a>

<b> What do Legos have to do with ligaments? </b>

In my first semester of Human Anatomy we discussed in great detail the inner parts of the body. The one common misconception was the differences between ligaments and tendons. In studying I used a memory aid. Ligaments are like Legos because they are hard and you always connect Legos to other Legos. This leads to the idea that bones are connected to other bones using "Lego"ments. 

As a future teaching tool I would use Legos to connect bones. The anterior side of the Lego would have labels stating the ligament name and the posterior side of the Lego would have the bone location. For the ACL there would be two Legos. Both Legos would match on one side and complement each other on the other.

Example for the ACL:

Lego 1, Posterior: intercondyloid eminence of the tibia
Lego 2, Posterior: anterior horn of the lateral meniscus

<b> Switching to the iPhone...Maybe </b>

I am considering taking a leap into the iPhone environment. I have been a Samsung user since I put down my Blackberry Curve. I started with the Samsung Galaxy S1, S4, and have been owning the S7 for the past couple years. I will be tracking over the next year what the pros and cons of switching will be. The iPhone is currently my front runner with the Galaxy S10, Pixel 3, and Note 10 falling just behind.

* * *

<b> iPhone Switch Pros </b>
-Superior performance and smoothness
-Simple interface with software that just works
-FaceTime with family members

<b> iPhone Switch Cons </b>
-Loss of paid Android applications
-Need to purchase a new apps
-Have to use iTunes for podcasts
-Far less customization
-Loss of the headphone jack

* * *

<b> Pixel 3 Switch Pros </b>
-Pixelbook instant tethering for mobile hotspots
-Maintain my paid Android applications
-Superior camera

<b> Pixel 3 Switch Cons </b>
-Loss of paid Android applications
-Glitchy Google software


* * *

<b> Galaxy S10 Switch Pros </b>
. . .

<b> Galaxy S10 Switch Cons </b>
-Loss of paid Android applications

* * *

<b> Note 10 Switch Pros </b>
-Squid mobile application support

<b> Note 10 Switch Cons </b>
-Loss of paid Android applications
-Squid mobile application currently lacks easy device-to-device movement. I have to manually backup to Dropbox and restore onto my cell-phone.

* * *

<b> Other things to consider </b>
-One time paid for apps are moving to subscriptions. The apps that I have previously purchased may lose developer support or move to a subscription. In this case, staying with android for my paid for applications will no longer be as strong of an incentive.
-I like a good camera, but I am not going to buy a smart phone only because it has the best camera. I remember one of the first HTC devices having a great camera, but was slow. I was the only phone I ever returned.

<b> Pixelbook Pen First Impressions </b>

I went ahead and decided to pick up a Google Pixelbook Pen. I was originally very tentative about the idea of spending $100 for a pen, but when I saw it went on sale on Amazon for $82 it was enough for me to take a chance on it. I went to Best-Buy and they were able to price-match me for the difference in price, which was a huge plus. All in all, I have been very pleased with the value that was added to my Pixelbook. The pen is probably not worth $82, but the combo of both the pen and the Pixelbook is definitely worth about $800. I am using the application Squid in order to take notes and edit PDFs. It is perfect for the Pixelbook and the pen. I have noticed a short lab between writing at times, but it is very periodic and only lasts for about 1-3 seconds. If you keep writing it catches up to itself with no problem. The pen is very fluent and easy to use. I have edited PDFs and forms and even signed them. The work flow has been a huge plus. The ability to edit PDFs with the pen has made Adobe Acrobat DC pro mostly unnecessary. I also noticed some discussions on cases and places to put the pen. I have had great sucess with using the small white box that the pen came in. I keep the pen in the box until I need it and I often use the box as a method of propping the PB up while I write on it in tablet mode. I also like the small slot in the box for an extra 'AAAA' battery for the pen. The pen and box, charger, and flash drive comfortably fit in my tomtoc carry bag. So far, I am loving the way PDFs can be organized within Squid. I am looking forward to using Squid and my PB pen in this semester's classes that I am taking. One more thing, I've tried the magnetic mounting areas on the PB with the pen and they work, but not as well as I would like. The pen slides off and isn't very secure. Besides, I wouldn't want the pen to be rubbing up against the PB while it was in the case. The magnet is only a temporary solution that is too risky for me. I like for the pen to sit safely in its box next to me while I work.

<b> How I use Adobe Scan, Dropbox, and Squid on a Google Pixelbook </b>

<b> Wachete </b>

<a href="https://www.wachete.com/"> A quick shout out to Wachete for making a really useful web application. It monitors websites for changes. I have used it to monitor sites that offer software updates for radio equipment. Very useful for staying up to date on the most current details of an important webpage. </a>
