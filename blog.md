"North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota"

You might overlook this quote from the popular Red Hot Chilli Peppers song, but when you live in the state you can't help wonder -- What were they talking about?
My best guess is this is a connection to the great adventure settlers embarked on during their travels out west for gold. I've never consider ND a "western" area and infact Minot was considered the end of the line on the rail road. Minot is a small city in north central ND. 

Another blog described it pretty well and even used the verse from the RHCPs to name the blog (very creative):

<a href="https://gunninforthequota.wordpress.com/about-2/"> "Yes, I am going to North Dakota, a state with fewer people than Cobb County, Georgia.  The natural gas boom in the Bakken Region of western North Dakota has spurred sensational growth in the state, and just like the days of yore with gold mining and oil drilling, people are flocking to cash in on the riches.
Me?  Well, Iâ€™m no prospector, and even if I was, the time to strike it rich in North Dakota has unfortunately come and gone." </a>

<b> Pixelbook Pen First Impressions </b>

I went ahead and decided to pickup a Google Pixelbook Pen. I was originally very tentative about the idea of spending $100 for a pen, but when I saw it went on sale on Amazon for $82 it was enough for me to take a chance on it. I went to Best-Buy and they were able to price-match me for the difference in price, which was a huge plus. All in all I have been very pleased with the value that was added to my Pixelbook. The pen is probably not worth $82, but the combo of both the pen and the pixelbook is definitely worth about $800. I am using the application Squid in order to take notes and edit PDFs. It is perfect for the Pixelbook and the pen. I have noticed a short lab between writing at times, but it is very periodic and only lasts for about 1-3 seconds. If you keep writing it catches up to it self with no problem. The pen is very fluent and easy to use. I have edited PDFs and forms and even signed them. The work flow has been a huge plus. The ability to edit PDFs with the pen has made Adobe Acrobat DC pro mostly unnecesary. I also noticed some discussions on cases and places to put the pen. I have had great sucess with using the small white box that the pen came in. I keep the pen in the box until I need it and I often use the box as a method of propping the PB up while I write on it in tablet mode. I also like the small slot in the box for an extra 'AAAA' battery for the pen. The pen and box, charger, and flashdrive comfortably fit in my tomtoc cary bag. So far I am loving the way PDFs can be organized within Squid. I am looking forward to using Squid and my PB pen in this semester's classes that I am taking. One more thing, I've tried the magnetic mounting areas on the PB with the pen and they work, but not as well as I would like. The pen slides off and isn't very secure. Besides, I wouldn't want the pen to be rubbing up against the PB while it was in the case. The magnet is only a temporary solution that is too risky for me. I like for the pen to sit safely in its box next to me while I work.
