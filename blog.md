I enjoy finding technical solutions to problems. I have learned over the years that we often think that we need more software or programs. Microsoft office can do what we need and more.

<b> Switching to the iPhone...Maybe </b>

I am considering taking a leap into the iPhone environment. I have been a Samsung user since I put down my Blackberry Curve in 2010. I started with the Samsung Galaxy S1, S4, and have been owning the S7 for the past couple years. I will be tracking over the next year what the pros and cons of switching will be. The Note 10 is currently my front runner with the Pixel 4 and iPhone falling just behind. With the release of the Galaxy S10, I have been tempted to purchase a new phone. I have not done it because the Galaxy S7 has continued to perform. I have noticed some slow downs, but all-in-all I am content with my current device. To maintain performance I must factory reset my phone about once every 6-9 months. I am holding out because the next iteration of iPhone might be good enough to switch me over. I have removed the Galaxy S10 for now just because I don't see myself switching to it anytime soon. I had some time with the S10 at Bestbuy and I actually do not care for it. The power butter is way too high on the S10+ and the user interface is odd to me. I'm sure I would get used to it, but it just doesn't have a good feel. I am likely to install and use the Nova Launcher. It has become a huge asset in my Samsung Galaxy S7 experience. I think the Note 10 and iPhone will be the two phones I will have to compare and purchase in fall 2019.

  * Pixelbook instant tethering for mobile hotspots (heard it is glitchy and somewhat unreliable)
  * Maintain my paid Android applications
  * Superior camera (A+)
  * Google call screening (won't get used all that often now, but maybe in the future)

<b> Note 10 Switch Pros </b>
  * Squid mobile application support

<b> Note 10 Switch Cons </b>
  * Squid mobile application currently lacks easy device-to-device movement. I have to manually backup to Dropbox and restore onto my cell-phone. (I stopped doing this because it takes too much time and is glitchy)

<b> Other things to consider </b>
  * One time paid for apps are moving to subscriptions. The apps that I have previously purchased may lose developer support or move to a subscription. In this case, staying with android for my paid for applications will no longer be as strong of an incentive.
  * I like a good camera, but I am not going to buy a smart phone only because it has the best camera. I remember one of the first HTC devices having a great camera, but was slow. It was the only phone I ever returned after trying for a couple days.

<b> Final Conclusion for All Phones </b>

<b> Device </b>
  * Note 10 (+3)
  * iPhone (0)
  * Pixel (0)

<b> Pixelbook Pen First Impressions </b>

<i> The Pixelbook and it's Pen </i>

  * I went ahead and decided to pick up a Google Pixelbook Pen. I was originally very tentative about the idea of spending $100 for a pen, but when I saw it went on sale on Amazon for $82 it was enough for me to take a chance on it. I went to Best-Buy and they were able to price-match me for the difference in price, which was a huge plus. All in all, I have been very pleased with the value that was added to my Pixelbook. The pen is probably not worth $82, but the combo of both the pen and the Pixelbook is definitely worth about $800. 

<i> Key Applications </i>

  * I am using the application Squid in order to take notes and edit PDFs. It is close to perfect for the Pixelbook and the pen. I have noticed a short lag between writing at times, but it is very periodic and only lasts for about 1-3 seconds. If you keep writing it catches up to itself with no problem. The pen is very fluent and easy to use. I have edited PDFs and forms and even signed them. The work flow has been a huge plus. The ability to edit PDFs with the pen has made Adobe Acrobat DC pro mostly unnecessary. I also noticed some discussions on cases and places to put the pen. I have had great sucess with using the small white box that the pen came in. I keep the pen in the box until I need it. I also like the small slot in the box for an extra 'AAAA' battery for the pen.
 
 <i> Final Thoughts </i>
 
  * The pen and box, charger, and flash drive comfortably fit in my tomtoc carry bag. So far, I am loving the way PDFs can be organized within Squid. There is some software limitations, but I am hopeful they will be fixed eventually. For instance, exporting a PDF doesn't always work. I am looking forward to using Squid and my PB pen in this semester's classes that I am taking. One more thing, I've tried the magnetic mounting areas on the PB with the pen and they work, but not as well as I would like. The pen slides off and isn't very secure. Besides, I wouldn't want the pen to be rubbing up against the PB while it was in the case. The magnet is only a temporary solution that is too risky for me. I like for the pen to sit safely in its box next to me while I work.

<b> How I use Adobe Scan, Dropbox, and Squid on a Google Pixelbook </b>

<i> I will use these ten steps to quickly digitize paper handouts. This is helpful if you would like to markup or write on papers digitally. If you are trying to go paperless, then this process must be down pat. This is my best solution based on my positive experiences with Adobe Scan. </i>

"North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota"

You might overlook this quote from the popular Red Hot Chili Peppers song, but when you live in the state you can't help wonder -- What were they talking about?
My best guess is this is a connection to the great adventure settlers embarked on during their travels out west for gold. I've never considered ND a "western" area and in fact Minot was considered the end of the line on the rail road. Minot is a small city in north central ND. 

Another blog described it pretty well and even used the verse from the RHCPs to name the blog (very creative):

<a href="https://gunninforthequota.wordpress.com/about-2/"> "Yes, I am going to North Dakota, a state with fewer people than Cobb County, Georgia.  The natural gas boom in the Bakken Region of western North Dakota has spurred sensational growth in the state, and just like the days of yore with gold mining and oil drilling, people are flocking to cash in on the riches.
Me?  Well, I’m no prospector, and even if I was, the time to strike it rich in North Dakota has unfortunately come and gone." </a>

<b> What do Legos have to do with ligaments? </b>

In my first semester of Human Anatomy we discussed in great detail the inner parts of the body. The one common misconception was the differences between ligaments and tendons. In studying I used a memory aid. Ligaments are like Legos because they are hard and you always connect Legos to other Legos. This leads to the idea that bones are connected to other bones using "Lego"ments. 

As a future teaching tool I would use Legos to connect bones. The anterior side of the Lego would have labels stating the ligament name and the posterior side of the Lego would have the bone location. For the ACL there would be two Legos. Both Legos would match on one side and complement each other on the other.

Example for the ACL:

Lego 1, Posterior: intercondyloid eminence of the tibia
Lego 2, Posterior: anterior horn of the lateral meniscus

<a href="https://www.wachete.com/"> A quick shout out to Wachete for making a really useful web application. It monitors websites for changes. I have used it to monitor sites that offer software updates for radio equipment. Very useful for staying up to date on the most current details of an important webpage. </a>
