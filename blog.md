"North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota"

You might overlook this quote from the popular Red Hot Chilli Peppers song, but when you live in the state you can't help wonder -- What were they talking about?
My best guess is this is a connection to the great adventure settlers embarked on during their travels out west for gold. I've never consider ND a "western" area and infact Minot was considered the end of the line on the rail road. Minot is a small city in north central ND. 

Another blog described it pretty well and even used the verse from the RHCPs to name the blog (very creative):

<a href="https://gunninforthequota.wordpress.com/about-2/"> "Yes, I am going to North Dakota, a state with fewer people than Cobb County, Georgia.  The natural gas boom in the Bakken Region of western North Dakota has spurred sensational growth in the state, and just like the days of yore with gold mining and oil drilling, people are flocking to cash in on the riches.
Me?  Well, Iâ€™m no prospector, and even if I was, the time to strike it rich in North Dakota has unfortunately come and gone." </a>

<a href="https://www.wachete.com/"> A quick shoutout to Wachete for making a really useful web application. It monitors websites for changes. I have used it to monitor sites that offer software updates for radio equipment. Very useful for staying up to date on the most current details of an important webpage. </a>
