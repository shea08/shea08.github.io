<b> LPFM Radio </b>

From the studio to transmitter link (STL) to the radio automation system I have found myself learning how to upkeep an LPFM station. I excel at learning to troubleshoot the software. I have installed firmware updates on our STL, automation system, and the transmitter. LPFM is awesome because two small rooms filled with equipment and a tower can make a message that can fill an entire city! We even succeeded at moving an entire station from one building to the next. It is amazing the amount of IT and networking required to make an LPFM station functional. We actually use a Barix unit to send the audio traffic from the studio location all the way to the transmitter. The Barix is considered a site-transmitter link. From what I have been told, the Barix was never designed to do this work. It was intended for use in train stations as a method of public address. However, it has proved to be a very reliable device. There is one Barix at each end - one to send and another to receive.
