<b> LPFM Radio </b>

From the studio to transmitter link (STL) to the radio automation system I have found my self learning how to upkeep an LPFM station. I excel at learning to troubleshoot the software. I have installed firmware updates on our STL, automation system, and the transmitter. LPFM is awesome because two small rooms filled with equipment and a tower can make a message that can fill an entire city!
