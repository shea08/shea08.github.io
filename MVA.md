## The Statistics of Road Injury
"All trauma patients require a systematic approach to management to maximize outcomes and reduce the risk of undiscovered injuries."

To give this discussion context The <a href="https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/”>World Health Organization</a>'s global health estimates in 2016 found that the #1 cause of adult death was Ischaemic heart disease (16.6% of all deaths). Road injury was the #10 cause of adult death with 2.5% of all deaths.
## Collect this info
This is a list of Important information that can be collected right away. Each item would be considered useful to the emergency response team. 
- Age and sex
- Pulse
- Seat belt use
- Steering wheel deformation
- Airbag deployment
- Direction of impact
- Damage to the automobile (especially intrusion into the passenger compartment)
- Distance ejected from the vehicle

Interesting facts:
- <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18248707”>Hypotension generally does not manifest until at least 30 percent of the patient's blood volume has been lost </a>
- Hemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of mortality in trauma.
- Up to 39 percent of trauma patients have injuries that are initially missed, and up to 22 percent of these are clinically significant.
