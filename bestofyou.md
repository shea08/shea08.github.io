<b> Best of You </b>

This song is found on the Foo Fighters’ album ‘In Your Honor’. It was released way back in 2005. But I have to say it is one of my favorite songs that I come back to time and time again. It has that great indie rock sound and has meaningful lyrics, which is always a big plus for me. My absolute favorite lyrics comes in at the one-minute point. Dave Grohl says…

“I was too weak to give in”
“Too strong to lose”

This is the human dynamic and struggle that I think we all go through at one point or another in our lives. It is that our pride and determination can come at our own detriment. It is the saying, “my own worst enemy”. The idea is this. Being too weak or too strong can be a bad thing. The middle ground is almost always the place to be. Flexibility is the key. Slow and steady wins the race. This song is a pouring out of that struggle with being too weak and too strong in certain areas of life. It is this struggle, which gets the best of us.

Is something getting the best of you? What can we do to even the odds between our weaknesses and our strengths? What do you think this song is saying?
