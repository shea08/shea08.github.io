<b> Wachete </b>

<a href="https://www.wachete.com/"> A quick shout out to Wachete for making a really useful web application. It monitors websites for changes. I have used it to monitor sites that offer software updates for radio equipment. Very useful for staying up to date on the most current details of an important webpage that doesn't have RSS feed. </a>
