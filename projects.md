## Android Mobile Applications

This is a list of the mobile applications that I use on a regular basis. I enjoy using each of these apps and highly recommend them. I am currently operating these apps on a Samsung Galaxy S7.

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod"> BeyondPod </a></b>

This application is great for managing a collection of podcasts. I regularly listen to several different podcasts in the car and at the gym. This application is awesome because it can automatically download new episodes on a schedule. I download my newest episodes about an hour prior to leaving for work in the morning.

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epocrates"> Epocrates </a></b>

I use this application to research and learn about pharmaceuticals that I see in my CNA duties. It is a great, free resource for learning about correct dosages, uses, and mechanisms of action for different types of medications.

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hiqrecorder.full"> Hi-Q MP3 Voice Recorder (Pro) (Beta) </a></b>

This application has been great for recording audio from my Galaxy S7. It can record in MP3 and .wav without any problems. It even has the ability to auto-amplify the audio, which helps for recording something fairly quiet. It also can backup to Dropbox, which has been helpful. It is really great for gettig files off my phone because it can open the files up to the local network. I use this periodically when I don't have a USB cable. It simply works!

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.hurry"> Hurry - Countdown to Birthday/Vacation (Beta) </a></b>

I use this for tracking big items that are coming up in the future. It makes the long-term calendar really fun with GIFs. I share big events with friends and family to remind them when things are coming up. I track concerts coming to town, new video game releases, and new movies most often on here. I also set reminders for things that might expire like my passport, license, car insurance -- just to name a few.

Lately, I have been using Hurry to keep track of homework assignments for my college classes. It helps me prioritize which tasks need to be done before others.

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.ingress"> Ingress </a></b>

A fun GPS game that I play when traveling. It helps me find interesting art and points of interest.

<b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kflkfm"> KFLK </a></b>

God's Word, 95.9 FM. A great Minot area radio station that teaches God's Word 24/7.

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher"> Nova Launcher (Beta) </a></b>

I use this launcher on my Galaxy S7. It really makes the phone customizable and sleek. If I didn't have this app I would be tempted to buy a new phone every year because I love customizing and changing the setup within my phone. 

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries"> Our Groceries Shopping List </a></b>

It simply works! My wife and I use this app all the time for tracking what we need to get at the store. 

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm"> Tasker </a></b>

Tasker required some work to learn; but the benefits have been huge. This app allows for "if this, then this" kind of customizability. I have created several "apps" that allow me to do things I otherwise would be unable. For instance, I have an app that allows me to auto-text when I arrive and leave particular common locations. It also has enabled me to auto-silence and do not disturb on my phone when I flip it onto its screen-face. When I plug in my head-phone jack, my phone automatically turns the volume up all the way and asks me what music app I would like to listen to.

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uptodate.android"> UpToDate </a></b>

I use this app and Epocrates to research and learn about all things medicine. UpToDate is very comprehensive and is like a search-engine for all things medicine, plus it is peer-reviewed and very trustworthy. 

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.weather"> Weather Timeline - Forecast </a></b>

The most user friendly and beautiful weather app I have ever used. It another app that is worth every penny!

<b> Feedback after using the Pixelbook from July 2018 - December 2018 </b>

The Pixelbook has largely been a perfect laptop for being a college student. I have found that the addition of the Google Play store has been the biggest improvement on the original budget Chromebook that I started using in 2015. The majority of the Android apps work great, but they are equally as limited in use as you would expect on your phone. I also use Office 365 periodically and have tried Libre Office and Google's line of documents. I often wish I had the full desktop version of Microsoft Office on my Pixelbook. Libre office often crashes and has compatibility problems. Google docs works, but is not nearly as powerful as a full copy of Office 2016. As a power user Office 365 often falls short of what I am trying to get done. If I could run Microsoft Office on my Pixelbook, then it would be the perfect machine for me. 

I really enjoy using the android Spotify app on my Pixelbook because it streams in very high-quality audio. If you use the Chrome application or the web browser streaming service the quality is limited to average quality. Most people won't notice the difference, but if you have ever listened with a really nice set of headphones (Bose or Sennheisser) -- then you will definitely notice when audio is encoded over Bluetooth or lacks quality. It's like going to the eye doctor and finding out your eyes are slightly degraded. The first time you wear glasses and you realize how clear your vision can actually be after having corrected vision, it blows your mind. The same thing happens with a great set of headphones and super-high quality audio streamed through Spotify. 

Other critiques:

I wish the bezels weren't so large. There is lots of wasted screen space on the Pixelbook.

The front facing web camera is really low quality. For how good the camera is on the pixel phone -- I would have expected something better on the Pixelbook.

The power switch is placed in a position where I find myself turning my device off my accident a lot. It is too far forward and is exactly where you hold the laptop to pick it up and move it around or show someone the screen. "here let me show you something"...powering off...well, at least the startup time is like 15 seconds.

# Education and Learning

<b> Biology </b>

<a href="https://www.amentanatomy.com/biol-220.html"> Biol-220 Anatomy & Physiology I </a>

<b> Things I have learned that I think is cool </b>

- The anatomical name for the human thumb is <b> Pollux </b>.
  - The name pollux is originated from the root -poll, which is the same root that the word politician comes from. The root also has similar origins as the common saying "I have you under my thumb". The thumb is thought to be an originator of power and strength. Therefore, for this reason, politicians have great power in their governmental role. 
  
- The <b> Hyaline Cartilage </b> is a very translucent material found in the body. It lines many places nearby bones and joints. It is critical to the development of bone; even within the developing human being. It forms the embryonic skeleton. It is also found within the trachea.
 
 <i> hyalo- </i>
 
- The root word comes from Greek hyalos "glass, clear alabaster, crystal lens used as a burning glass,". This apparently had origins in a non-Greek word, said to be of Egyptian origin. It is thought that glass was first large-scale produced in Egypt.

<b> The Biblical Connection to Glass and "Hyaline" </b>

<i> "and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind" Revelation 4:6 ESV </i>

<b> Pronunciation: \ˈhī-ə-lən \ </b>

Mnemonic for learning: High-e-len. We will recall that God is seated on high, on His throne, and surrounded by a sea of glass, like crystal. "But You, Lord , are on high forevermore." Psalms 92:8 NKJV

<b> How To Remember the 15 Human Tissue Types </b>

Mnemonic for learning: TLC-MD (Tender Loving Care-Medical Doctor)

Story to connect the pieces of TLC-MD; In the Air Force if someone falls and breaks a <b> bone </b> (BON) we will write an <b> after-action-report </b> (AAR). This is certain to occur if it happens at <b> F.E. Warren, AFB. </b> (FEH). Before the person can leave, we must run a <b> spinal-cord simulation </b> (SCS). If all goes well we will go to <b> Recreational Equipment Inc. </b> (REI) because we want to have better gear to prevent falling and breaking a bone.

<b> Etymology </b>

I was first introduced to word etymology in Mr. Brail's High School English AP class. He would tell us about a new word every week and I was always interested in learning the next story of how words were made. I find the history of words to be captivating and interesting. I studied Spanish for three years in high school and this has given me an inept appreciation and joy for Latin, words, and the connections you can make to history and root words.

I spend a lot of time looking up words on https://www.etymonline.com/

<b> LPFM Radio </b>

From the studio to transmitter link (STL) to the radio automation system I have found my self learning how to upkeep an LPFM station. I excel at learning to troubleshoot the software. I have installed firmware updates on our STL, automation system, and the transmitter. LPFM is awesome because two small rooms filled with equipment and a tower can make a message that can fill an entire city!

<b> Microsoft Office 2007-2016 </b>

I began using office way back in my high school days. I started by learning word composition, then excel, and have slowly worked my way into Access and Publisher.

<b> Microsoft Access </b>

A wonderful tool for managing people, places, and things. The ways to manage and interact with a database is truly endless. I love learning about a process that exists within an Excel spreadsheet when it could better be done within Access. The reporting feature is one of my favorite tools. Automation is my friend and Access is a great tool to learn for saving time. I have built many databases from scratch for a specific process and purpose. 

<b> Microsoft Excel </b>

I started using excel as a method for calculating my grades in high school and college. My favorite thing to do is take a syllabus and determine what grade I need in a class in order to get the grade I desure. Equation can be very powerful. My favorite tool is the "countif" equation and the conditional formatting function. The most useful tool I have created is a running calendar using an equation to auto-populate the day of the week until infinity. I then insert shapes to create events.

<b> PC Building and Repair </b>

I have built two PCs with the help of a friend. I checked compatibility and ordered the parts online. I run a pretty robust PC that backs up the drives using Goodsync. The first PC I built was a gaming PC. The second was a PC built to become an LPFM automation and studio computer. I like being able to isolate the problem to one area of the computer (usually the hard drive) and then replacing that part and seeing the difference that was made after replacing the part. SSDs have made a big difference, but I have also seen formatting  drives cause the OS drive to appear to fail. In fact, that is how I came to have an extra hard drive that runs Linux. It is perfect for troubleshooting and special projects that don't work well in Windows.
