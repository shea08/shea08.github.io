# Introduction

## Android Mobile Applications

This is a list of the mobile applications that I use on a regular basis. I enjoy using each of these apps and highly reccomend them. I am currently operating these apps on a Samsung Galaxy S7.

<b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod"> BeyondPod </a></b>

This application is great for managing a collection of podcasts. I regularly listen to several different podcasts in the car and at the gym. This application is awesome because it can automatically download new episodes on a schedule. I download my newest episodes about an hour prior to leaving for work in the morning.

# Education and Learning

<b> Biology </b>

<a href="https://www.amentanatomy.com/biol-220.html"> Biol-220 Anatomy & Physiology I </a>

<b><u> Things I have learned that I think is cool </b></u>

- The anatomical name for the human thumb is <b> Pollux </b>.
  - The name pollux is originated from the root -poll, which is the same root that the word politician comes from. The root also has similar origins as the common saying "I have you under my thumb". The thumb is thought to be an originator of power and strength. Therefore, for this reason, politicians have great power in their governmental role. 

<b> Books </b>

A listing of books I have read and reccomend by the year that I read them :

<b> Etymology </b>

I was first introduced to word etymology in Mr. Brail's High School English AP class. He would tell us about a new word every week and I was always interested in learning the next story of how a word I find the history of words to be captivating and interesting. I studied spanish for three years in high school and this has given me an inept appreciation and joy for latin and words...More to follow
