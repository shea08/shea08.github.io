<b> Microsoft Office 2007-2016 </b>

I began using office way back in my high school days. I started by learning word composition, then excel, and have slowly worked my way into Access and Publisher.

<b> Microsoft Access </b>

A wonderful tool for managing people, places, and things. The ways to manage and interact with a database is truly endless. I love learning about a process that exists within an Excel spreadsheet when it could better be done within Access. The reporting feature is one of my favorite tools. Automation is my friend and Access is a great tool to learn for saving time. I have built many databases from scratch for a specific process and purpose. 

<b> Microsoft Excel </b>

I started using excel as a method for calculating my grades in high school and college. My favorite thing to do is take a syllabus and determine what grade I need in a class in order to get the grade I desure. Equation can be very powerful. My favorite tool is the "countif" equation and the conditional formatting function. The most useful tool I have created is a running calendar using an equation to auto-populate the day of the week until infinity. I then insert shapes to create events.
