<b> Harry Houdini - Death by Peritonitis </b>

Harry Houdini is very well known for his amazing feats of magic, illusion, and death defying tricks. Both his life and death were intriguing in their own ways. Houdini died at the age of 52, October 31st, 1926. 

Check out this video and a few articles from History and the Smithsonian Magazine to learn more about the life and death of Houdini.

I found it interesting that <a href="https://www.huntsvillehospital.org/tennessee-valley-pediatric-surgery”>Dr. James C. Gilbert</a> said that Houdini “may have ruptured his intestines” even though some believe that appendicitis caused his death. Dr. Gilbert reiterates that he may have had appendicitis as a serendipitous occasion. However, his official cause of death was peritonitis, which is an “Irritation of your abdominal lining”. In this case if his intestines had ruptured, then the inflammation was only one factor that compounded into his eventual demise. It is only one part of the story.

# What can be learned from Houdini?

He waited to seek medical attention, which directly contributed to the progression of his diseased abdomen. Reportedly he died from peritonitis and secondarily a ruptured appendix. Appendicitis is known as the most common surgical emergency in the world with a lifetime risk of 8.6 percent in males and 6.9 percent in females (Körner et al). 

## Appendicitis

- The appendix is attached to the large intestine and specifically the cecum. 

- It is considered the inflammation of the appendix.

## Description

Appendicitis is described in two manners:

1. Nonperforated (simple or uncomplicated)

2. Perforated

## Why does it occur?

- Appendicitis is ultimately caused by a luminary blockage (appendiceal obstruction)

## Key Symptoms

1. Right lower quadrant (right anterior iliac fossa) abdominal pain
- Pain can change depending on the anatomical position of the appendix. It can be as low as the pelvis and as high as the superior right lower quadrant.
2. Anorexia (lacking desire to eat)
3. Nausea and vomiting
## Other Symptoms

Each symptom increases in severity as the inflammation worsens. For example, a low-grade fever is seen early on, but as time goes by the fever gradually rises.

-- Increased WBC count
-- fever
-- emesis
--- dehydration
--- electrolyte abnormalities
-- septic or hemodynamically unstable 

## Is the appendix perforated or not?

 <b> Treatment for perforated and stable </b>

- Antibiotics (Cover gram-negative rods and anaerobic organisms)
- Interval appendectomy (remove the appendix after a baseline treatment of antibiotics have been taken)

## Treatment for perforated and unstable

- Emergency appendectomy

## Treatment for stable and non perforated

- Timely appendectomy
- Antibiotics to augment treatment (not replace)

## What does a surgeon do if upon appendectomy the appendix is normal?

- The uninflamed appendix is still removed.

## Other things to consider

There is a long and variable list of diseases that can add to the differential diagnosis. The urinary system, female reproductive system, and other peritoneal illnesses can be responsible for similar symptoms. 

Appendicitis is not usually caused by abdominal trauma. For this reason, Harry Houdini likely suffered from a ruptured intestine. This would have led to sepsis and bacterial infection. There is a chance that he started to have a luminary blockage around the same time he was punched in the gut. The pain he initially felt was explained by the abdominal impact. This could explain his initial denial of care. Did he have a family history of appendicitis? We will never truly know, but this is a good starting place to consider the dynamics of appendicitis and peritonitis.
