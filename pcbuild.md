<b> PC Building and Repair </b>

I have built two PCs with the help of a friend. I checked compatibility and ordered the parts online. I run a pretty robust PC that backs up the drives using Goodsync. The first PC I built was a gaming PC. The second was a PC built to become an LPFM automation and studio computer. I like being able to isolate the problem to one area of the computer (usually the hard drive) and then replacing that part and seeing the difference that was made after replacing the part. SSDs have made a big difference, but I have also seen formatting  drives cause the OS drive to appear to fail. In fact, that is how I came to have an extra hard drive that runs Linux. It is perfect for troubleshooting and special projects that don't work well in Windows.
