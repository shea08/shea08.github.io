### ABSTRACT

The 91st Missile Wing drove approximately 4 million miles last year on U.S. highways and gravel roads in North Dakota (Pape, 2016). This study focused on the UA-HMMWV (Up Armored-High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle). Military security forces (SF) that operate these vehicles suffered from a high rate of lower back pain and vehicle rollover. These rollover accidents are especially common in the HMMWV when driving on gravel roads. This study focused on whole-body vibration (WBV) and its human health and performance effects in relation to driving armored vehicles. Acceleration data was measured using an iPod Touch that was outfitted with an application that measured WBV. An iPad Mini was used to measure reaction time. A survey was conducted to determine discomfort and back pain. The study postulated that as the WBVs in an armored vehicle increase then there will be a significant increase in back discomfort and pain in armored vehicle operators. This study also suggested that there is a positive dose-response correlation between the length and magnitude of exposure to WBV and response-time in an armored vehicle. Nine of the eighteen vibration dose values were within the Health Guidance Caution Zone.

### <b> ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </b>

I want to express my full thanks to all parties that have played a part in this study. To include my wife, Chelsea for always being at my side and willing to sacrifice in order to pursue an advanced education. I am very thankful to Dr. Blyukher, Dr. Sheldon, Lt Col Nelson, and the Airman of the 91st Security Forces Group. This project would not have been possible without the flexibility and dedication of the Minot AFB leadership and team. They have provided a wealth of mentorship, support, and guidance through authoring this project.

## CHAPTER 1 <b> 
  
### INTRODUCTION

Several studies have found that continual exposure to WBV will increase lower back pain and health problems of workers (Zengyong Li et al., 2012; Arslan, 2014). At Minot Air Force Base, (MAFB) there are many remote underground Launch Facilities (LFs) that are defended around the clock by military security forces (SF). The LFs house one of the nationâ€™s most powerful weapon systems; The Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). Airman of the U.S. military are tasked with driving heavy armored vehicles on often unruly and uneven gravel roads. The primary goal of this project was to quantify the relationship of WBV, response time, and lower back pain using consumer electronics.
