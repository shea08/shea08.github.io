## <b> The Five Stages of Grief and the movie Adrift </b>

The movie Adrift is based on a true story of a couple’s plan to sail across the Pacific Ocean and return to San Diego California on a yacht. Richard was a 34-year-old from England. Tami was a 23-year-old from San Diego. They set out in their mid-size boat in 1983 with high hopes of making a years’ worth of travel expenses. The couple encounters hurricane Raymond and all of their future plans unravel. The final outcome and climatic conclusion is that Richard is lost at sea while fighting to keep the yacht afloat.

The movie Adrift spends the next 99 minutes portraying the internal memories of, Tami, who survived the storm. Tami survived 41 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean. She experienced grief throughout this experience.  The movie demonstrates the KÜbler-Ross model and the five stages of grief. We shall briefly discuss the model and how it is applied in the movie Adrift.

## <b> What is grief? </b>

“Grief is the natural response (including thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and physiologic reactions) to bereavement. Although grief can occur in response to other meaningful (non-bereavement) losses, this topic focuses primarily upon grief in response to the death of a loved one.” (UpToDate)

## <b> What are the five stages of grief? </b>

1.	Denial
2.	Anger
3.	Bargaining
4.	Depression
5.	Acceptance

## <b> Why is it also known as the KÜbler-Ross model? </b>

The five stages of grief (also known as the Kubler-Ross model) was proposed by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in her book On Death and Dying in 1969.

Discussion of the Movie Adrift as it Applies to the Five stages of Grief

## <b> 1. Denial in the Movie Adrift </b>

The peculiar thing is that Tami believes that Richard is alive and with her. In fact, he was lost at sea from the very beginning. Denial is an ongoing step in this example. Sometimes flashbacks occur and a deep sense of longing for the person is seen in the sudden and unexpected loss of a loved one. It is common for hallucinations and constant thoughts about the person to be experienced. This film shows the vivid memories that Tami experiences. As Tami fights off starvation, dehydration, and the elements she must also contend with her mental ability to support the grieving process.

## <b> 2. Anger in the Movie Adrift </b>
 
The first scene that we witness grieving is when Tami realizes that Richard is not on the piece of boat debris. She attempts to find him, but only finds that the tie-off line had detached and he was tossed overboard. The first emotion that she portrays is that of anger. She is angry because the tie-off line failed. 

* * *

## <b> 3. Bargaining in the Movie Adrift </b>

Bargaining is seen in the flashback of Tami and Richard deciding to go on the trip and sail across the ocean. She bargains that if she had been adamant about her feelings, then Richard would still be alive. Tami expressed concern over returning to San Diego California. She says, “I’m not ready to go home”. 
 
She never actually enters a state of depression because she is focused on survival. The remainder of the movie is spent going back and forth between the current time and memories spent with Richard.
 
<i> “one’s sense of identity is disrupted and exploration is inhibited, leading to reduced interest in ongoing life and an unfamiliar sense of incompetence and confusion about long-term goals.” </i> UpToDate

Tami has trouble navigating, and is frustrated, but continues onward with the determination to continue and to survive. The idea of long-term goals is not mentioned in the movie because her grief never fully matures.

## <b> 4. Depression in the Movie Adrift </b>

 True depression probably did not occur for many weeks. Tami was unable to process and unwrap her feelings while prioritizing her return to civilization. It would have been normal for Tami to return to the five stages of grief many times in the next five years after the incident. 

* * *
 
## <b> 5. Acceptance in the Movie Adrift </b>

Tami comes to realization and accepts that Richard is gone by saying “I don’t need you anymore. I am letting go”. Tami must change her internal relationship with Richard. She only fully comes to term with her loss by understanding who Richard is and how he affects her moving forward in life. She must be able to forecast and plan her life around the idea of being without him. She must essentially say goodbye and accept the reality of her loss.

According to UpToDate, the symptoms of separation distress that a person can exhibit when facing difficult loss include:

- [ ] Yearning for and seeking proximity to the deceased
Loneliness
- [ ] Crying, sadness, and other painful emotions (eg, anger, guilt, and anxiety) that occur upon confrontation with reminders of the loss
Somatic symptoms including distressing physical sensations and disrupted sleep or appetite
- [ ] Insistent thoughts and memories of the lost person, sometimes including hallucinations
- [ ] Feeling drawn to things associated with the deceased
Social withdrawal and disinterest in other people and activities not associated with the deceased
- [ ] Confusion about one’s identity and feeling lost or uncertain without the deceased
