## <b> Feedback after using the Pixelbook from July 2018 - December 2018 </b>

The Pixelbook has largely been a perfect laptop for being a college student. I have found that the addition of the Google Play store has been the biggest improvement on the original budget Chromebook that I started using in 2015. The majority of the Android apps work great, but they are equally as limited in use as you would expect on your phone. I also use Office 365 periodically and have tried Libre Office and Google's line of documents. I often wish I had the full desktop version of Microsoft Office on my Pixelbook. Libre office often crashes and has compatibility problems. Google docs works, but is not nearly as powerful as a full copy of Office 2016. As a power user Office 365 often falls short of what I am trying to get done. If I could run Microsoft Office on my Pixelbook, then it would be the perfect machine for me. 

I really enjoy using the android Spotify app on my Pixelbook because it streams in very high-quality audio. If you use the Chrome application or the web browser streaming service the quality is limited to average quality. Most people won't notice the difference, but if you have ever listened with a really nice set of headphones (Bose or Sennheisser) -- then you will definitely notice when audio is encoded over Bluetooth or lacks quality. It's like going to the eye doctor and finding out your eyes are slightly degraded. The first time you wear glasses and you realize how clear your vision can actually be after having corrected vision, it blows your mind. The same thing happens with a great set of headphones and super-high quality audio streamed through Spotify. 

## Other critiques:

  * I wish the bezels weren't so large. There is lots of wasted screen space on the Pixelbook.

  * The front facing web camera is really low quality. For how good the camera is on the pixel phone -- I would have expected something better on the Pixelbook. I also wish there was a decent camera on the outside of the front cover so that it could resemble an actual tablet.

The power switch is placed in a position where I find myself turning my device off my accident a lot. It is too far forward and is exactly where you hold the laptop to pick it up and move it around or show someone the screen. "here let me show you something"...powering off...well, at least the startup time is like 15 seconds.
